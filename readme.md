## Dataset

> The data consisted of 16 different variables such as age, gender, weekday, time and others. There were 6.25 billion rides. Ages in dataset from 18 to 56 takes 95% of the users in dataset. There were users more than 100 years old. So, we can remove users more than 60 years old. I generated new fields such as duration, time, age groups etc. to calculate them easily and understand the dataframe. Ford GoBike avail the service to San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose. However, it's hard to imagine traffic. So regarding this complexity, I decided to focus on San Fancisco area by limiting with latitude and longitude.

## Summary of Findings

> Ages from 18 to 56 takes 95% of the users. There are users more than 100 years old. We can remove users more than 60 years old.
> During the winter months of November, December and part of January, there is a drastic decrease in riders.
> 20-30 years old users are rapidly growing compared to other user groups. When the service first started 30-40 years old users were dominant, however 20-30 years old users became leader in a year.
> Subscribers have most frequently used this service around 7~9am and 4~6pm. Customers have used this service at weekend around 10am~5pm and weekday 5pm~6pm.
